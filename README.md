# Conversational Question Anwering System
This repository contains various methods explored for Conversational Q&A System. on [CoQA Dataset](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/coqa/). 

## Methods
FlowQA: Implemented LSTM and GRU-based Flow-QA architecture
GraphFlow: a GNN based architecture with various embeddings
Transformer: BERT base and BERT large architectures

In total we performed **13 different experiments** and found Transformer based architecture gives the best F1 score on the validation set.
